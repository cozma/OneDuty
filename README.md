# OneDuty
> OneDuty is a simple lightweight PagerDuty solution for OSX. It operates as a Menubar application that can be opened for queries, or just used in an idle state to display who is on call for your team. In the full application mode, it lets you look up any team schedule at your company and will let you see who is on call for the team on that schedule. You can also select future dates and grab the contact information for who is on call. Using the "Set Default" method lets you display who is on call on the OSX menubar, which also updates daily.
